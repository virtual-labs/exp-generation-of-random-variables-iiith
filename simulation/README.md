# Random Variables Generation Simulation

This simulation provides an interactive visualization tool for generating and analyzing random variables from various probability distributions. It is designed for educational purposes in pattern recognition and probability theory.

## Features

- Generate random variables from multiple distributions:
  - Uniform
  - Normal (Gaussian)
  - Exponential
  - Poisson
  - Binomial

- Interactive visualization options:
  - Histogram display
  - Probability Density Function (PDF)
  - Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)
  - Grid overlay

- Real-time statistical measures:
  - Mean
  - Variance
  - Standard Deviation
  - Skewness
  - Kurtosis

- Animation controls:
  - Generate single sample
  - Animate generation
  - Pause/Resume
  - Reset

- Export capabilities:
  - Save visualization as image
  - Export generated data as JSON

## Usage

1. Select a distribution type from the dropdown menu
2. Adjust distribution parameters using the sliders
3. Set the desired sample size
4. Click "Generate" to create a single sample or "Animate" for continuous generation
5. Toggle visualization options to show/hide different plots
6. Use the export buttons to save your results

## Technical Details

The simulation is built using:
- HTML5 Canvas for visualization
- Vanilla JavaScript for interactivity
- CSS3 for styling and responsive design

No external dependencies are required.

## Browser Support

The simulation works best in modern browsers that support HTML5 Canvas and ES6 features:
- Chrome (recommended)
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge
