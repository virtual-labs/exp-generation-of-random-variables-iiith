The high level goals of the experiment are:

  1. To understand the nature of randomness and how they are characterized.

  2. To understand the difference between discrete and continuous random numbers.
  3. To understand the process of generation of random numbers with a desired density/distribution.

  4. To understand the practical limitations and advantages of randomness generated using algorithms.
