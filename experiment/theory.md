### Methods of Generating Random Numbers

Since computers are deterministic machines, they cannot generate true randomness. There are two main approaches to generate random numbers:

#### 1. Physical Random Number Generation
- Uses physical devices (sensors) to capture natural phenomena
- Converts the readings to digital form
- Provides high-quality randomness
- More expensive and complex to implement
- Used in applications requiring high security or scientific accuracy

#### 2. Pseudorandom Number Generation
- Uses special algorithms called [Pseudorandom Number Generators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator)
- Generates sequences that appear random
- More efficient and cost-effective
- Most commonly used method
- Quality depends on the algorithm used

#### 3. Hybrid Approach
- Combines both methods
- Uses operating system parameters as seed for randomness
- Balances between quality and efficiency
- Useful for applications requiring moderate randomness quality

### Distribution Transformation
The random numbers generated by any of these methods will follow a specific distribution. To obtain numbers following a desired distribution, we need to:

1. Generate random numbers using one of the above methods
2. Transform these numbers to follow the target distribution
3. Verify the transformed numbers match the desired distribution
